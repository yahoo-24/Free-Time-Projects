This project is an AI maze solver. It explores the maze and finds the shortest route to the end point
if it exists.
To solve this problem I have implemented the A* algorithm which always leads to the correct solution.

The code makes use of 2 modules: The colorama module which allows me to print the result in a way that
the user can see the path easily, the NumPy module where I used ndenumerate and abs.
