# CPU

## Description
This is an implementation of a CPU using and old version of VHDL (GHDL).

### Usage Instructions
There are several files included all of which are necessary for CPU.vhdl to run. A test bench CPU_tb is also included to test if the CPU works. The result is shown in CPU.vcd. In my case, I have used gtkwave to see the output of the .vcd file.

## Technologies Used
